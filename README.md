# My_Developer_Journey

# 👩‍💻 Hello, I'm Malka!

I'm a second-year BCA student with a foundation in the basics of C and C++. While these languages gave me a good starting point, I wanted to explore something more modern, lightweight, and aligned with current development trends.

After doing some research, I chose to learn **Golang (Go)** — a clean, fast, and efficient language that felt exciting and practical for real-world projects. I want to learn by doing, not just watching tutorials.

While preparing to learn Go, I discovered that **Linux is widely used for development** and decided to set it up myself. I watched videos, read blogs, and installed **VirtualBox and Ubuntu**. It was a challenging process — it took me about **6 days**, working **3–4 hours a day**. There were moments of frustration, but I didn’t give up.

Finally, I set up my development environment with **Ubuntu, VS Code, and Golang**. Now I'm ready to dive into Go development and build my skills one step at a time. 🙌

This repository is my **learning journal**, where I document:
- ✅ What I’ve learned in Go
- 💥 Challenges I face along the way
- 🔍 How I solve or understand those challenges

I have many goals, but at this stage, I’m focused on starting — and seeing where this **learning-by-doing** journey takes me.

Let’s grow together! 🚀
