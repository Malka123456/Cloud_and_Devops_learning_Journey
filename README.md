# **Cloud & DevOps Learning Journey**  

### **Current Focus**  
Final-year BCA student building expertise in cloud-native technologies through hands-on practice.  

### **Learning Path**  
- **Languages:** Golang (primary), C/C++ (prior experience)  
- **Platforms:** Linux (Ubuntu), Virtualization (VirtualBox)  
- **Core Stack:** Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Networking  
- **Method:** Project-based learning + open-source contributions  

### **Progress**  

#### **Week 1 (June 12–19, 2025)**  
- Set up Ubuntu on VirtualBox (self-guided, 6 days troubleshooting).  
- Configured Go development environment (VS Code, CLI tooling).  
- Practiced Git workflows for collaboration.  

#### **Week 2 (June 20–26, 2025)**  
- Learned Go fundamentals (syntax, functions, error handling).  
- Explored concurrency (goroutines, channels) and interfaces.  
- Compared Go vs. C/C++ memory management and design patterns.  

### **Next Steps**  
1. **Deepen Systems Knowledge:**  
   - Linux internals (processes, networking, permissions).  
   - Containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).  
2. **Contribute to CNCF Projects:**  
   - Document findings and submit small fixes (docs, tests).  

### **Why This Approach?**  
- Cloud-native tools demand **practical fluency**, not just theoretical knowledge.  
- Open-source contributions force **real-world problem-solving**.  
- Public documentation holds me accountable and helps others.  🧠 Topics Covered (Ongoing)
