# Networking Fundamentals

## What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a system in which multiple computers and devices are connected to share information and resources. These resources can be files, internet access, printers, etc.

> üîπ Example: When your mobile phone connects to your Wi-Fi router to access the internet, it‚Äôs part of a small home network.

## Types of Networks (By Size and Scope)
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Covers a small geographic area like a home or office.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a city or a campus.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Covers large areas; the Internet is the largest WAN.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Very small range, like Bluetooth devices.

## What is the Internet?
The Internet is a vast global network made by interconnecting smaller networks. It uses a standard protocol suite (TCP/IP) for communication and data exchange.

> üåê Origin: Evolved from **ARPANET** in the late 1960s by the U.S. Department of Defense.

## Key Components of a Network
| Component | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Clients** | Devices that request services | Laptops, smartphones |
| **Servers** | Devices that provide services | Web, DNS, FTP servers |
| **Protocols** | Rules for communication | TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS |
| **Transmission Medium** | How data travels | Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi |

## Network Topologies (Basic Layouts)
- **Bus**: All devices connected on a single cable.
- **Star**: Devices connect to a central switch/hub.
- **Ring**: Devices connect in a circle.
- **Mesh**: Every device connects to every other.

## Internet Infrastructure
- **Submarine Cables**: Connect continents under oceans.
- **ISPs (Internet Service Providers)**: Offer internet access to users.
- **IXPs (Internet Exchange Points)**: Where ISPs exchange traffic.
- **Tier 1 ISPs**: Form the core "backbone" of the internet.

## Data Transmission Basics
- Data is broken into **packets**.
- Each packet may take a different route.
- Packets are reassembled at the receiver end.

## Bandwidth, Speed, and Latency
- **Bandwidth**: Max amount of data that can be transferred (in bps).
- **Speed**: Actual rate of data transfer.
- **Latency**: Delay in data transmission (measured in ms).
