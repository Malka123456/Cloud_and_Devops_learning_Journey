# Networking Learning Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my comprehensive learning journey through computer networking fundamentals, from basic concepts to practical implementations. The material is structured to build knowledge progressively, with hands-on labs reinforcing theoretical concepts.

## Learning Path

### 1. Core Concepts
- Networking fundamentals
- OSI and TCP/IP models
- Protocol deep dives

### 2. Network Infrastructure
- Physical components
- Topology designs
- Media types and selection

### 3. Data Flow
- Encapsulation process
- Protocol interactions
- Traffic analysis

### 4. Practical Applications
- Real-world implementations
- Lab configurations
- Troubleshooting scenarios

## Lab Environment Setup

### Recommended Tools:
1. **Simulators**:
   - Cisco Packet Tracer (beginner)
   - GNS3/EVE-NG (advanced)
2. **Protocol Analyzers**:
   - Wireshark
   - tcpdump
3. **Virtualization**:
   - VirtualBox
   - VMware ESXi

### Skill Development:
- Network design and implementation
- Configuration management
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
